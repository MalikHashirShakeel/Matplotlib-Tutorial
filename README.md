# 🎨 Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Welcome to my Data Visualization project! This repository showcases various visualization techniques using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, two of Python's most powerful libraries for creating meaningful, attractive, and publication-ready plots.

Whether you're exploring trends, distributions, or relationships in data, this project covers essential tools and techniques to do it all visually.

## 📊 What You Will Learn

### ✅ Matplotlib
- Basic line plots, titles, and legends
- Scatter plots with custom markers and colors
- Bar plots (vertical & horizontal)
- Histograms and density plots
- Pie charts and area fills
- Subplots and figure control
- Image visualization with `imshow` and colormaps

### ✅ Seaborn
- Statistical plots with ease
- Built-in color themes and palette customization
- Scatter plots with grouping (`hue`, `style`, `size`)
- Categorical plots: `barplot`, `boxplot`, `violinplot`, `stripplot`
- Distribution plots: `distplot`, `kdeplot`, `histplot`
- Correlation heatmaps and pair plots
- Multi-plot grids with `FacetGrid` and `PairGrid`
